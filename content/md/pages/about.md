## Music Taste

I listen to vary of music genre. Most notable artists that I like are [Ichiko Aoba](https://www.youtube.com/@ichikoaoba-hermine) and [Sia](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN9HPn2fq-NL8M5_kp4RWZQ). Here are two songs from them:

## Programming Journey
UI stuff is neat, so I enjoy doing it. 

I used to work as a Front-End developer in most of my career. Then, not too long ago, I switched career to Mobile Developer.
While switching out my career, I did things like, creating/co-creating local programming community like [AndroidDev Surabaya](https://www.instagram.com/androiddevsurabaya/), [SurabayaJS](https://surabayajs.org/), [Flutter Jakarta]() and also volunteered on [Google Developer Group Surabaya](https://www.meetup.com/flutter-jakarta/). On the meantime, I taught some native Android (Java and Kotlin) in a collaboration with __Kemkominfo__ (Ministry of Communications and Informatics) called **SMKCoding**. Then I completely snapped to mobile development since.

Flutter was the new addiction to me. I enjoy doing it until now.

I am, now, also exploring new Clojure → Dart things that I excited to, [ClojureDart](https://github.com/Tensegritics/ClojureDart).

Made simple utility from it and for it to. Please check [cljds](https://pub.dev/packages/cljds) out.
