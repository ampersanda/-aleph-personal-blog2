Pretty packed today with some refactor task, onboarding and my first Hot Potato. Met virtually with some new Alephians including from abroads.

First day refactoring to remove `flutter_hooks` pretty hard doing it with test included. Especially, the widgets that brought to us, kinda, bad designed (in a code way), so pretty rough changes.
