Planned to go to PRDI office but WFH schedule kept me out of my place. All I can say is "Good luck for Patient App team!".

Had some meetings with my brand new Flutter team, discussing materials like standardizing branch namings, commit prefixes and scan to _the deep of code lore of Prodia Doctor project_.

Found some points that need to be discussed and improved with team, such as:

1. Linters
2. Barrel imports
3. Unused imports
4. Immutability
5. Inconsistent import methods
6. Type safety
7. Null-safety type for models
8. Singleton and static methods
9. `const` for app performance improvement
10. `typedef`
11. Slivers
12. Removing `flutter_hooks`
13. BANG (`!`) and how to use it properly
14. `freezed` and migrating from `json_serializable`
15. Explaining intents
16. Sizing
17. Icon Fonts
18. Testing
