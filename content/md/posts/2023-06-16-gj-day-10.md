Packed full of meetings today. Back to back from Stand Up, Sync Up, "Evidence" Meeting and Technical interview for new Flutter candidate (but sadly he didn't come).

Also mas Dio gave me 20 CVs to be reviewed. I don't think I ever asked to do something HR related, quite new experience yet fun.

Couldn't attend creative jam in the afternoon, because, wow what a wild rain since the morning time.
