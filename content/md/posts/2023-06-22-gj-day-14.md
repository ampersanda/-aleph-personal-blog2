Didn't go to office because some rest I needed.
Joined some meetings and discussed some on the result with Flutter Team.

Also, interviewed candidate with mas Arfan.  

Also did pair-programming session to debug and fixed the Active Chats problem that Ilham had a hard time to. 

Got to introduce myself when Hot Potato in the afternoon.

Then continue refactoring some hooked widgets since SIP tasks are blocked by design. 11 left and 5 E2E tests are also needed to be fixed.
