Pretty annoyed by today because of the difficult of getting access to QA testing permission.

First, we didn't have permission to upload SIT to TestFlight.
Secondly, we didn't have SIT credentials for QA testing, so we had to use UAT environment.
Third, certificate access suddenly revoked by someone, so we couldn't generate local IPA file.
Fourth, some of us didn't get the update of Codemagic capability to be used, because we mostly focused to generate it locally.
Fifth, I didn't have access to Codemagic.

The dominoes kinda fell down.
