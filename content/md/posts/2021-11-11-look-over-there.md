## Verse 1

**E**

When the sun is waking up,

**A**

From its darkest time

**Esus2**

Looking up to window,

**A A6**

I see some neighbors come

**Dbm**

Seeing some of them bind their hand

**A F#7**

No gaps between, into one

**Db A E**

While we found each other

**B E**

somewhere through the line

---

## Verse 2

**E**

Moving out, we got no distance

**A**

So I can visit yours

**E**

Meeting you, one of the greatest time

**A A6**

No regrets in mind

**Db**

If I cloud say my feelings,

**A F#7**

right away that time

**Dbm A E B E**

Maybe we can skip this non-sense of mine

---

## Chorus

**E Dbm A E**

Even now, I have the chance
My voices mute all the time

**E Dbm A B**

The flowers bloom
Each other, we face
You might know my heart’s in race

**Db     A F#7**

I don’t know what’s wrong with me, then
Seems, I stunned before one’s eyes

**Db A E B E**

Look over there, your smile shines to my eyes

---

**E**

I can’t ask coffee become to sweet

**A**

without giving them sugar

**Esus2**

Look over here, these sparks were disappear

**A F#7**
From being overtime

**Dbm**

I’m still hoping we could still like each other

**E F#7**

But we have a different walk

**Dbm A E B E**

But over here, I still at places we were talk
