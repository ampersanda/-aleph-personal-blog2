A comeback I'd say! This is the "second" first day I got in in Aleph Labs.

Even tough this morning I got a wrong direction of bus to Aleph, but still I got in time before 10am. 

The Aleph's onboarding for new employees was quite different than the last time I visited this place. Got free lunch tho! hahaha.

Still saw some faces I recognized like Gamal, Ellisa, mas Tum-Tum and also quite a lot new ones.

Also introduced to my PRDI Flutter team that pretty warm, Josh, Ilham and Arfan.

What a day!
